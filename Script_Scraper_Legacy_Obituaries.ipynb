      "BIOGRAPHY-Jensen Dr. William August \"Bill\" Jensen, Ph.D., 87, passed away quietly on September 9, 2014 at the Sanctuary Facility in Dublin, Ohio after a long illness. He was born in Chicago, Illinois on August 22, 1927 to William and Gertrude Jensen who preceded him in death. He is survived by his son, Scott, his wife (Rachael) and grandson, (Connor); and his daughter, Christina (Mack), husband (John); and two grandsons, (Zachary and Andrew); all from his first marriage to Joan Sell (deceased). Twenty-six years ago Bill met and married his loving, wonderful and caring wife Beverly (Bailey) who joined her family of four daughters with Bill's family, Kathy (Hollingsworth) and husband (Tom); Ann (Dickson), grandson, (Dean Hindenlang and partner Eric Wells); granddaughter, Sarra (Hamilton) and husband (Michael); great grandson, (Carlin); and great granddaughter, (Danielle); Karen (Carter)and husband (Maurice) and grandson, (Aaron); and Mary Beth (Webb) and husband (Ken) and grandsons, Jordan, Jensen, and Jarret, wife (Mindy); and great granddaughter, (Ayla). Prof. Jensen led a very distinguished and full professional life. He received his Ph.B. (1948), M.S. (1950) and Ph.D. (1953) all from the University of Chicago. During his Ph.D. he held Atomic Energy and Public Health predoctoral fellowships at the University of Chicago and Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark. Just before he began his undergraduate program at the University of Chicago, Bill was drafted into the service at the end of the WW II. He never saw active duty but worked in an army hospital lab. He continued in the reserves during his schooling and returned to Europe to the Carlsberg Lab (with Prof. Heinz Holter) in Copenhagen where he completed his Ph.D. research. During his graduate work he married his first wife Joan Sell and they explored Europe and this set the stage for his future love for travelling to many places in the world. Upon returning from Europe he carried out postdoctoral work at the California Institute of Technology (with Profs. Arthur Galston and James Bonner)(1953-55) and in the laboratory of Prof. Jean Brachet in Brussels, Belgium (1955-56). He then accepted an Assistant Professorship at the University of Virginia (1956-57) and then the same at the University of California, Berkeley (1957) where he quickly rose through the ranks to Professor of Botany. During his tenure at UC-Berkeley, he held positions of Chairman of the Department of Botany and also of Instruction in Biology, as well as Assistant and Associate Dean of the College of letters and Science. In 1973-74, he was Program Director of Developmental Biology at the National Science Foundation. Bill was invited to move to\n",
      ", Columbus in 1984 where he became Dean of Biological Sciences (1984-1999) and Professor of Plant Biology until his retirement in 2009. Prof. Jensen was a man of many talents and interests. His early professional interests were in the areas of cell differentiation associated with plant embryos and embryo sac development which led him to combine techniques of histochemistry and electron microscopy, pioneering approaches at that time. From this work he became a sole author of the still popular book Botanical Histochemistry (1962). He mentored numerous graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who hold and have held major teaching and research positions at institutions of higher learning in the United States, Canada and Europe. His research has been published in over 100 articles in a variety of excellent journals. Throughout his career he developed a passion for teaching at both the graduate and undergraduate levels and received several important awards for these efforts from the University of California, the Ohio State University and the Charles E. Bessey Award from the Botanical Society of America. At the Ohio State University in his later years he taught very popular large classes to non-science majors that enjoyed his portrayals of famous scientists and his multimedia presentations. His authoring of entry-level texts in General Botany and General Biology supported this love for making botany and biology fun and understandable. Prof. Jensen gave generously to professional societies such as AAAS, the Botanical Society of America, and the American Institute of Biological Sciences. He was a Fellow of AAAS and the California Academy of Sciences, and received the Merit Award (Distinguished Fellow) from the Botanical Society of America where he served in a variety of capacities including its President in 1978. From an early age when he joined the high school science club because of his interests in biology, botany and microscopes, as well as playing the clarinet, to his adult life where biology, botany and microscopes continued to be focal points, Bill was always enthusiastic, curious, questioning, and pushing-the-envelope kind of person who loved challenges and always expected the best from himself and others. His insatiable curiosity and talent for creating beautiful, abstract, color pen drawings of images he had studied with his electron microscope became his passion in later years. He loved doing them, displayed them at art shows, sold them and sometimes gave them away as gifts. Prof. Jensen, 'Bill', you lived a full life, trained, mentored and taught countless young people to love botany and biology. You did this with dignity, humor, humbly and with a deep-seated love for humankind. Such a legacy will live on through your dear wife Beverly, your family, friends and colleagues for many years to come. We will miss you. Family will receive friends Sunday, September 14, from 1 p.m. until the time of the memorial service at 3 p.m. at SCHOEDINGER NORTHWEST CHAPEL, 1740 Zollinger Rd., Columbus, OH, Rev.

      "David Mark Johnson died at his home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on December 24, 2013. David grew up in Ann Arbor, the fourth child of Professor James D. Johnson and Natalie R. Johnson. David was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. At Ann Arbor Pioneer High School David played varsity tennis and excelled in academics, but it was his musical gifts that moved him into the limelight. As a freshman, David achieved the honor of being named the first chair trumpet in the concert band. At the University of Michigan, David studied Electrical and Computer Engineering and achieved accolades and honors in class and during internships. After completing his Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the U of M, he went on to pursue work in integrated circuit design for his internship sponsor, Cascade Design Automation of Seattle, Washington. While at Cascade Design Automation, David presented a number of papers for which he received awards. David was recruited by Motorola's Paging Products Group in Boynton Beach, Florida to work as an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chip designer. During his tenure at Motorola, David was the co-author of a number of papers and patents. During his engineering career, David presented papers, attended seminars and performed design work in the United States, Israel and Japan. In his free time in Seattle, David enjoyed playing soccer with his colleagues and jet skiing on Lake Washington. In Florida, David returned to playing tennis. Throughout his life David enjoyed listening to music, watching movies, and reading. David was preceded in death by his father James and survived by his mother Natalie, brothers Neil and Eric, sister Carol Johnson Kartje (who died February 4, 2014), nephew Peter Kartje as well as numerous cousins, aunts and uncles.

      "The people who knew Marilyn were lucky. She instilled knowledge, know-how and spirit in so many. Just being around her made people feel special. Belying her 5'1\" height, her stature in life was immeasurable. Born third of five kids to Walter and Sybil Lewis in Fortuna, CA, she loved the coast but moved to Redding in 1955.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great, natural athlete, she was an excellent swimmer and navigated bottoms of rivers holding rocks for weight. At Fortuna High School, she was awarded a letter for achievement in Physical Ed. while still a sophomore, the youngest in their history, excelling at basketball and ping-pong. She could walk on her hands, ride bikes backwards, twirl batons, and tap dance as well as play the harmonica, piano, and guitar. She was an artist, seamstress, barber, gardener, and cook. She hunted, fished, camped, and played cards, horseshoes, darts, pool, tennis, softball and bowled. But at 60, after group lessons, golf became her obsession and you never had to ask where her ball was, 'cause it was always right down the middle.\n",
      "\n",
      "A talented mentor, she was instrumental in the proliferation of Scouting in Shasta County, a den mother for over eleven years to Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Webelos while also active in the P.T.A. Brownies and Girl Scouts benefited from her involvement too. Being prepared, she always carried a pocket knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raised on a dairy and ranch, she was at home among cowboys, loggers, animals, and equipment. If it had wheels, she could drive it, including dump trucks on job sites, and knew more about engines than most men. She became a school bus driver. She went on to garner accreditation as a driver instructor through and for Shasta College. Friends nick-named her 'The Professor'. She loved driving bus for Shasta Co. Schools. Transporting Special Ed. children was her forté. Her innate ability to turn a bad situation around is legendary.\n",
      "\n",
      "She thrived, however, on training bus drivers. She went to the Cal. Highway Patrol Academy for more training and had tons of fun driving on their \"grease pad.\" The C.H.P. worked closely with the driver trainers and had long lasting, working friendships. Eventually she was promoted to supervisor, dealing with everything from driver evaluations, routes and dispatch to maintenance and endured this unpopular position until retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1984, Marilyn and co-worker, Steve Corella, (a former student), were honored with coordinator positions over the bus and transportation personnel at the Olympics in L.A. They could have written a book about the trials, tribulations, events and laughs they had while there.\n",
      "\n",
      "She worked with C.A.S.T.O. for years. She was a member of the V.F.W., the Moose, I.O.O.B., Frog Club, N.R.A. and Presidents Advisory Board. She belonged to the Shasta Niners and was an avid, die-hard Giants fan. In NASCAR, she raced with Rusty Wallace and Carl Edwards. She was a charter member of Palo Cedro Golf and later joined Allen's Golf Club. Proud to be an American is an understatement. She deemed voting not only a right, but your duty as an informed citizen. Humor runs rampant in this family and Marilyn just got wittier with age. Nurses and doctors alike loved her as a patient because of her niceness and lack of enmity. They also marveled at her resilience. Her heart doctor called her 'delightful'.\n",
      "\n",
      "With family members from every generation serving in most arms of the military, she was a passionate supporter of our veterans and generous to a fault, donating to Republican Party Candidates, the N.R.A., Easter Seals, Shriners, Cancer Research and other charities. Rush and O'Reilly kept her keenly abreast of truthful world news, but family was her oyster, youngsters the pearls. She loved reading, crosswords, and Sudoku! With a veritable library of maps, if you were lost or needed to find a better route, no matter where you were, call Marilyn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Believe it or not, she didn't care to be in the spotlight as she was a little bit shy. She could party with the best of them though. But she only drank when she smoked, and she only smoked so she could drink. About 20 years ago, she just up and quit smoking! Marilyn wore cowboy boots or high-heels with equal aplomb and was a great dancer in either. Truly an amazing, one of a kind, Renaissance woman, she should've been cloned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilyn outlived four husbands. She was predeceased by brothers, Billy, Ned and David; parents, Walter and Sybil and son Hal Willburn.\n",
      "\n",
      "She leaves lots of family: brother, Sheldon Lewis, 98, residing at the Veterans Home in Redding; son, Lin Willburn and wife, Donna, Hetten Valley, CA; Hal's wife, Patricia, also of Hetten; daughter, Billie Rae Willburn, Redding; sons, Tad Donoho of Redding, and Tod Donoho (Elda) of Auburn, WA; and daughter Maggie Rae Philoctéte, Newport Beach, CA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilyn said her favorite people called her Gram, of which there are 17 and 18 great-grandkids.\n",
      "\n",
      "This outline of her person and times would be more colorful with stories we hope that you share while attending a Celebration of Life at her home on Saturday, November 24, 11AM to 2PM or 2PM to 4PM at The Showboat.\n",

      "David was born March 20, 1935, to Reverend Kenneth Cruse Minter and Frances Hennessy Minter in Midland, Texas. He grew up in Gonzales, Woodville, and Alice, Texas, graduating from Alice High School in 1953.\n",
      "He received a BA and MA in English from North Texas State College in Denton, followed by a Bachelor of Divinity and a PhD in American Studies from\n",
      ". David began his academic career as a lecturer at Yale and then at Hamburg University in Germany. In 1967 he joined the English Department at Rice University. From 1973-1979, he and his wife Caroline served as Masters of Baker College.\n",
      "In 1980 David was recruited by Emory University in Atlanta. During his tenure there, first as Dean of Emory College and later as Vice-President for Arts and Sciences, Emory changed from a quality regional school into a top-tier national academic institution.\n",
      "After returning to Rice in 1990, David served numerous roles in addition to his teaching American literature. The Minters were Masters of Jones College (1992-1997). He was appointed Interim Vice-Provost and University Librarian (1995-1996) and Interim Provost (1999-2000). In 1999 then Rice President Malcolm Gillis, in naming him Interim Provost, stated that David was both \"a leading literary scholar\" and a \"truly outstanding teacher and mentor\" and that his record of service to Rice was \"one of the most distinguished and fruitful in the university's history.\"\n",
      "David's love of literature led him to become an eminent scholar of 20th century American literature and of William Faulkner. His several books included the definitive William Faulkner: His Life and Work. As well, his many teaching awards reflected his passion for teaching and his respect and regard for his students. His academic career spanned thirty-five years, after which he retired as the Bruce and Elizabeth Dunlevie Professor Emeritus of English.\n",

      "BIOGRAPHY-Charles W. Haldeman, III, age 82, of Concord, died peacefully at The Commons in Lincoln on Friday, July 6, 2018. He was the husband for 59 years of Louise (Stephenson) Haldeman. Born in Philadelphia in 1936, he was the son and only child of Charles Waldo Haldeman and Anna Douglass Haldeman. He spent part of his boyhood in Washington, DC where his father worked in a wartime government position. At that time, his uncle Paul Douglass was President of American University. As his uncle was a lifelong bachelor, the Haldemans lived at the Presidents house, where his mother served as her brothers hostess. During that time, the young boy had a chance to meet many people. He fondly remembered being taught piano by a visiting chemistry professor who lived at the house and found that the boy was more interested in chemical reactions (fireworks) than piano. Despite this, he remained an ardent lover of music and a BSO subscriber. Following the end of the war, the family returned to Pennsylvania where Charles finished high school. He was an outstanding student and also a high school gymnast. Always interested in science and engineering, he was offered an athletic scholarship to Penn State but headed for MIT instead. He entered college with a slide rule and retired from Lincoln Lab in 2012, by which time he had somewhat reluctantly accepted the computer in place of the slide rule. He received his B.S. and M.S. in the honors program in the department of Aero and Astro (Course 16). He worked first at the Supersonic Wind Tunnel, where he completed his Doctorate. When space flight was achieved, the testing facilities were no longer needed and the wind tunnel closed. He moved then to the Lincoln Laboratory where he spent several years, becoming a member of the senior staff. After 12 years in Lexington, he and Louise moved to Concord where they continue to live. However, severe Parkinsons Disease made it necessary for him to move to the nearby Lincoln Commons Assisted Living. Charles was the Scout Master of Troop 132 for a number of years. The Troop did a great deal of hiking, camping, and canoeing. As a fairly experienced hiker and hunter, his woodsman skills were excellent but he learned to handle a canoe on the job by applying basic aeronautical principles. He and Louise were longtime members of Hancock Church in Lexington where he served on several committees. In Concord, he served on the Board of Health for two terms and was a member of the original town committee, appointed to consider the former Nuclear Metals Site. He was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather. In addition to his wife, Louise, he leaves behind his sons, Charles W. Haldeman and his wife Margaret and George S Haldeman and his wife Siobhan, and three granddaughters, Katherine, Claire, and Maeve Haldeman. A memorial service at Hancock Church in Lexington will be held later this summer. Private interment will be at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory may be made to the Concord-Carlisle Community Chest, 19 Main Street, Suite 2, Concord, MA 01742. Arrangements are under the care of Dee Funeral Home & Cremation Service of Concord. To share a remembrance or to send a condolence in his online guestbook, please visit\n",

      ". In 1957 David joined the faculty of the Department of Architecture at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He participated in the founding of the School of Architecture and subsequently the College of Environmental Design (later named the College of Architecture and Planning).

In professional practice, Prof. Paulson was an associate and a partner in the Boulder Architectural Practice of Easton Associates, later the Easton Partnership. He was involved in the design of many Boulder area residences, educational facilities for the Boulder Valley School District, and the 1973 addition to the Canyon Boulevard facility of the Boulder Public Library, the Children's Library and Non-print Media Center that bridged Boulder Creek, which was his favorite built project.

      "David was a humble, selfless and dedicated man who worked tirelessly for his love of medicine and his family. He was a devoted husband, married to his wife Ann for almost 46 years who he called 'his one and only\"\". His daughter Carrie was the apple of his eye and his life was truly dedicated to these two women. When Carrie met her wonderful husband John, she knew she had found a man as good as her father. Together, they gave the greatest gifts David would ever know… his grandchildren, Grace and Luca. David's every moment since they were born were about loving them. And it is because of his love and family values, that his legacy will live on forever in these children.\n",
      "David's motto was \"\"Work hard, play hard\"\" and \"\"Live your life as if today is your last\"\". David's heart was in Aspen, Colorado, where he enjoyed many years of skiing and mountain life. He was an avid fisherman, having learned from his father. He loved fishing in Canada with his cousins, in Alaska with his best friend Joe Perrin and other friends and family, and closer to home in Galveston Bay. David was also an accomplished artist, with a love of landscape oil painting. And finally, his greatest past time love was Oklahoma football. A Sooner through and through, he never missed a televised OU game.\n",

William Pease was a 1942 graduate of MIT whose career began there, first as a Research Engineer in 1943 then a Professor of Electrical Engineering from 1949 to 1952. His early research interests centered on Numerical Control. In that capacity he was Director of MIT Servo-Mechanisms Laboratory, from 1952 to 1953, a period in which the labs pioneering developments in digital automation were reported by Time, Newsweek and Scientific American. Mr. Pease left MIT in 1953 for industry, serving first as Vice President for the Ultrasonic Corporation, later as an Engineering Program Manager at RCA, before joining Raytheon in 1963 where he remained the rest of his career. At Raytheon Mr. Pease directed projects in navigational systems for the NASA led space program. Later his work shifted to nautical radar where he and Marine Division colleagues developed a series of patented innovations that put Raytheon in the forefront of the collision avoidance field. Upon retirement from Raytheon in 1992, Mr. Pease continued to consult and work on marine autopilot systems, receiving his 27th career patent as recently as 2012 at the age of 92. William was born in Rockland, MA in 1920. But upon the sudden death of his father two years later, the family moved to The Sheltering Arms Home in Manhattan where his mother worked while raising six children. An aptitude for Math, combined with a facility for repair work around the facility, enabled him to attend the science program at Stuveysant High School in lower Manhattan. Upon graduation there he earned a full scholarship to MIT, where he went on to earn both undergraduate and graduate Engineering degrees. Mr. Pease received many citations and awards throughout his professional career from such as organizations as the U.S. Navy and the Numerical Control Society. A late-blooming tennis enthusiast, he was also founding member of the Wightman Tennis Center and received an honorary award from the New England Tennis Association for pro bono work on computerized rankings.

      "BIOGRAPHY-PEASE, William A longtime Metro-west resident and accomplished engineering innovator, passed away at Newton Wellesley Hospital on Friday May 26 at the age of 96. A 1942 Electrical Engineering graduate, William Pease's career also began at MIT first in research then as a Professor of Electrical Engineering. In that capacity he was Director of MIT Servo-Mechanisms Laboratory from 1952 to 1953, a period in which the lab's digital automation breakthroughs were reported by Time, Newsweek and Scientific American. In 1953, Mr. Pease left MIT for industry, first joining the Ultrasonic Corporation and RCA in Burlington before Raytheon in 1963, where he remained the rest of his career. At Raytheon, Mr. Pease directed projects in navigational systems for the NASA led space program. Later work shifted to nautical radar where he and colleagues developed a series of patented innovations that put Raytheon in the forefront of the marine collision avoidance field. Upon retirement from Raytheon in 1992, Mr. Pease continued to work on marine autopilot systems, receiving his 27th patent as recently as 2012 at the age of 92. William was born in Rockland, MA in 1920. After the sudden death of his father two years later, the family moved to the Sheltering Arms Home in Manhattan. An aptitude for Math, combined with a facility for repair work, enabled him to attend the science program at Stuyvesant High School in lower Manhattan and earn a full scholarship to MIT. William Pease is survived by four children (Barbara, William Jr., Leone and Robert) and 5 grandchildren (Kimberly, Alexander, Robert, Amanda and Sarah). The memorial service will be held at the First Parish Church in Weston. Donations in his memory may be made to the New England Home for Little Wanderers (www.\n",

Bill became a real estate appraiser where he won numerous awards. He was a member of the Society of Real Estate Appraisers and President of the Mission Chapter. He became head of the Appraisal Department at Great Western Savings and Loan where he worked for almost 30 years. He was always helping people, and because of his associations, he was able to help people acquire loans for large projects that became very successful. He took interest in his local community and helped the Almaden Valley Gymnastics Club when they were having trouble obtaining a loan. Bill stepped in and was able to help the club acquire a loan so many young girls and boys were able to continue their sport for years to come. Bill was active in the Optimist Club and the Foundry which helped at-risk youth. He loved sports, and he enjoyed helping the kids develop their talent and focus their energy in a positive way through their athletic ability. He worked to help them get scholarships and into good schools. Bill loved history, western movies, reading, white water rafting, and animals. Bill enjoyed attending all sports activities and events of his children and grandchildren. He was a loving and devoted husband, father and grandfather who loved being there for his family.\n",

      "http://tinyurl.com/k3a2tuc\n",
      "for his 2010 autobiography of his journey in science). The quality of his research was repeatedly recognized nationally and internationally with awards such as the American Dairy Science Association Borden Award for Dairy Foods Research (1958) and the Institute of Food Technologists' Stephen S. Chang Award for flavor research (1999). He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1966), and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. In 2014 he received an honorary Doctorate in Agriculture from Purdue University. Jim was also a remarkable teacher as indicated by three teaching awards including the Outstanding Teaching Award from the College of Food Agriculture and Environmental Science (1997). His graduate students have painted a very glowing picture of him as a teacher and for his ability to prepare them for their future. One ex-student told Jim that he hated one of Jim's courses but that he had been able to parlay what he had learned into a Vice-presidency in a leading corporation. Other students have stated that being known as one of Jim Harper's students had a significant cachet. The majority of Jim's professional career was spent as professor at the Ohio State University. He began in 1949 as an assistant professor in the Department of Dairy Technology and became a Full Professor in 1961. In 1981, Jim retired, was granted Professor Emeritus status, and moved to New Zealand to head up a group of researchers working on a whey protein concentrate program at the New Zealand Dairy Research Institute (NZDRI). They developed technologies that still bring in more than a billion dollars a year to New Zealand. In 1986 Jim returned to the United States where he worked as a consultant in the dairy and food industry. NZDRI, New Zealand Milk Products in Santa Rosa, CA, and the Wisconsin Dairy Research Center were among his clients. In 1992 he was asked to return to OSU to teach two core classes and in 1993 was offered the J.T. \"Stubby Parker\" Endowed Chair in Dairy Foods with initial research focusing on functional properties of dairy foods. After 20 years of research, teaching and graduating a whole new crop of graduate students, Jim retired for a 4th time in August of 2013. However, retirement looked rather like pre-retirement since he was still teaching, running a grant funded lab, and going into work five days a week. Jim had many hobbies such as fishing, camping, writing poetry, and painting, but his interest in orchids became a major part of his life growing from a few plants on the kitchen windowsill to several thousand in greenhouses. In addition to buying and trading for orchids, he traveled to many parts of the world to collect orchids including Mexico and Papua New Guinea. He is past president of the Central Ohio Orchid Society and currently on the board of directors as well as a qualified America Orchid Society judge. He will be deeply missed for his warmth, \"cute smile and laugh,\" for his enthusiasm for teaching, research and students, and for many great conversations. Jim's life will be celebrated at a memorial service and reception on Saturday, August 2 from 2-4 p.m. at the Ohio State University Faculty Club, 181 South Oval Dr., Columbus, OH 43210 (\n",

      ", where he was a student of Ross Lee Finney. He continued his studies with Lukas Foss, Boris Blacher, Nadia Boulanger and Max Deutsch. From 1954 until 1968, Harris lived in Paris where, among other things, he was music consultant to the United States Information Service and produced the city's first postwar Festival of Contemporary American Music. Harris has received numerous commissions, including the Serge Koussevitzky Music Foundation, St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, Radio France, and the Cleveland Orchestra, to name a few. He is co-editor of the W. W. Norton publication of the correspondence between Alban Berg and Arnold Schoenberg, for which he received an ASCAP Deems Taylor Award (1989). He was honored with an award in composition from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters (1991). A documentary about Harris entitled \"Sonata 1957\" was produced by Daniel Beliavsky in 2011. It explores Harris' development in mid-20th-century Paris, when pre-war musical thought bridged with post-war experimentation. Donald was honored by The King Arts Complex with a Legends & Legacies award in October 2011. He received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from OSU in June 2012. Harris is past president of The International Council of Fine Arts Deans (ICFAD) and served on the boards of BalletMet, Columbus Symphony Orchestra and the Martin Luther King Center. He was currently serving on the board of The Johnstone Fund for New Music. Harris was twice honored with the OSU School of Music's Distinguished Service Award \"in recognition of the trailblazing contributions and the dedicated service provided to the music profession and the arts community as a composer, professor and arts administrator.\" Aside from all the accolades and awards bestowed upon Donald, he will be remembered by most as a genuine, kind man who was a mentor to many.

      "BIOGRAPHY-Dr. Joseph K. Kovach was born February 1, 1929, to Akos and Karolin Kovach in Gödöllo, Hungary. Surrounded by his family, he died peacefully on November 17, 2016, of Alzheimer's disease. In 1944, he became separated from his family in the chaos of the final months of World War II. Only 15 years old and just trying to get home, he was caught in the advancing Russian front and spent the next 9 years as a prisoner of the GULAG labor camps in the Soviet Union. Following Stalin's death in 1953, he was released and returned to his family in Budapest, where he immediately went to work as a Russian-Hungarian simultaneous translator. After fleeing for his life during the 1956 Hungarian revolution, he came to the United States in January 1957, rapidly learned English, and was admitted to Elmhurst College where he took a double course load and graduated with high honors in only two years. Four years later he earned a Ph.D. in Comparative and Biological Psychology at the University of Chicago, where he had also joined the Committee on Social Thought under the mentorship of the renowned classicist, David Grene. As a career scientist in behavior genetics, he worked at the Menninger Foundation (1966-1993) where he was Director of the Research Department s Ethological Laboratory, Director of Research and Evaluation, member of the Management Committee of the Karl Menninger School of Psychiatry, Henry March Pfeiffer Professor of Research and Education in Psychiatry, and later Professor Emeritus. The recipient of numerous grants and awards, he served on editorial boards of major professional journals and was a reviewer for NIH, NIMH and NSF. He was a member of several professional organizations, gave invited presentations at national and international conferences, and was the author of numerous scientific articles, two books, several book sections and book reviews. In 1974, he earned his pilot s license and loved to fly his small airplane, with which he and his family explored his adopted homeland. He was particularly fond of the American Southwest where the family enjoyed camping and hiking. He had a passion for reading, especially Russian poetry, Tolstoy, Shakespeare, and classical literature. He was married to Nancy Shand. They later divorced. He married Magdalene Schlingensiepen (nee Hamel) and they enjoyed more than 40 years together. She survives; along with his sons, Dr. Ian Kovach (Laurie), Rev. Tobias Schlingensiepen (Abby), Dr. Christopher Kovach (with Rachel Gold); and daughter Ilsabe O Connell-Schlingensiepen (with James Curley); former children-in-law, Sarah Stafford, Ulrike Leonardi (Glen), Mitch O Connell and Catherine Kovach; brothers, Gyula, Istvan, Levente; sister, Katalin; 11 grandchildren, six step-grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren; and many nephews and nieces. He was preceded in death by his parents and sisters Eva, Vera, and Maria. For the special and loving care he received during the last few weeks of his life, his family extends their gratitude to the wonderful staff at Midland Hospice, to Michael Cox of First Congregational Church who helped by giving gentle, competent care, and to many others who gave him and his family so much love and support. Memorial service for Dr. Kovach will be at 11 a.m. Saturday, December 3, 2016, at First Congregational Church, 1701 SW Collins Avenue, Topeka KS 66604. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be sent to First Congregational Church, the Midland Center for Hope and Healing, 200 SW Frazier Circle, Topeka, KS 66606, or Amnesty International, 600 Pennsylvania Ave SE # 500, Washington, DC 20003.

      "BIOGRAPHY-Thomas Dudley Turner 1927-2015 It is with deep sadness that the family announces that Tom Turner, age 87, passed away on January 7, 2015. Tom will be lovingly remembered by his sons Timothy James Turner (Pat) of Onalaska, WI and Christopher Lynn Turner (Cheryl) of Prince Albert, Saskachawan, his grandchildren Katie, Sam and Andy and his brother Bill Turner (Rosa) of Santa Rosa, CA. He was predeceased by his parents Lyndon and Mable Turner of Eureka, his wife Mary Ellen Rogers of Fortuna, CA and brothers Darrell, Robert and Donald Turner. He will be dearly missed by his former students at Minot State University, his \"comrades\" in China, and his friends at the Veteran's Home in Yountville, CA. Tom was born and raised in Eureka, CA and had many fond memories of those times especially during the depression years. He was a third generation Humboldter and was proud of it. He attended Washington School and Eureka Junior and Senior High. He had great memories of his fun times with his brother Darrell (Doe), Harry Bistrin, Fuzzy Lampella, and many others. He was restless in high school and was anxious to get into\n",
      "so, just shy of graduation, he enlisted in the Navy at age 17. He was a signalman and served on the USS Breckenridge, USS Cadmus and the USS Kaskaskia. He loved his time in the Navy and at one time considered it as a career. He was discharged in 1947, returned home to Eureka, and had to wait awhile to reenlist. To take up his time, he enrolled in Humboldt State College and later graduated with a bachelor's and master's degree in Speech/ Drama. He taught at Hoopa High School and Arcata High School before enrolling in a Ph.D. program at Iowa State University. He accepted a teaching position at Chadron State College, Nebraska where he taught for several years before accepting a teaching position in the Speech and Theater arts department at Minot State College, North Dakota (now Minot State University - MSU). He spent many summers directing plays in a YMCA circus tent until it was destroyed in a freak wind storm. Following that incident, Tom worked with a fellow university professor to secure funding to build the Minot State Amphitheater, which will be celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer. Tom was a man of many interests. Not only was he a director he was also a playwright. Tom studied karate, he became a ham radio operator and a certified parliamentarian as well as a lock smith. He enjoyed hang gliding, even making his own hang gliders (which never flew). He had a keen interest in theater, and movies particularly the old Westerns and film noir classics. During his last few years at MSU he studied both French and Mandarin Chinese, and after retiring in 1990, he moved to Ghuangxou, China where he taught at Ghuangxou University. Tom finally retired and returned to Eureka where he continued his interest in studying Mandarin Chinese at home and at Humboldt State, learning to play the erhu, and enjoying his faithful dog Pongyou. Six years ago he moved to the Veterans Home of California in Yountville, CA. During his time there, he continued learning Chinese, he was learning to play the banjo, guitar and even the bag pipes much to the chagrin of his roommates. But his favorite instrument was the harmonica which always reminded him of his days growing up in Eureka. Even as Tom's health began to fail in the last couple of years, he continued working at the banjo and harmonica. He passed away January 7, 2015 at Yountville Veteran's Home from complications of pneumonia. At Tom's request there will be no services. He will be interred at Sunset Cemetery in Eureka, CA next to his parents and his brothers Darrell and Donald. He is terribly missed by his lone surviving brother. Please sign the guestbook at\n",

      "College of Law. While in law school, he met the love of his life, the sweet and beautiful Carolyn Murphy. In 1960, Stan and Carolyn were married in Cincinnati, Ohio. For their honeymoon, they drove across the country to Los Angeles, where Stan practiced at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher and Carolyn taught elementary school. Stan followed his love of the law into teaching and eventually returned to Columbus as a professor at Ohio State University College of Law, where he was a beloved professor for almost fifty years. Stan was especially interested in Constitutional Law and focused his research on studying the application of the Constitution to the U.S. Territories, publishing the leading textbook on the subject. Stan and Carolyn traveled extensively throughout the South Pacific, including many trips to Hawaii and traveling to American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, Truk, Yap, Guam and Fiji. Stan and Carolyn also spent multiple summers at Oxford University in England and brought the family to Oxford to join them and share in their love of England. Stan and Carolyn also traveled extensively throughout Europe. Stan loved baseball and was a life-long Reds fan and a loyal fan of the Columbus Clippers. He also loved OSU Football and Basketball, attending more games than we could count. Stan had a terrific sense of humor and told a great story (no matter how many times he told it). Stan had many other interests and loves but enjoyed nothing more than spending time with family and friends. He loved sharing a meal and endless laughter with his many lunch and dinner companions over the years. Stan was a member of St. Mark's Episcopal Church where he served three terms on the vestry. The last several years of Stan's life were enhanced by the friendship, love and support he shared with his family at First Community Village, where he was known for his devotion to Carolyn as her Alzheimer's disease progressed. Stan is survived by his wife of 58 years, Carolyn Murphy Laughlin; his three daughters and sons-in-law, Elizabeth and Dwight Anstaett, Diane Laughlin and Russ Neill, and Cathleen and David Bentley; four wonderful grandchildren, Sarah and Rachel Anstaett, and Ella and Owen Bentley; and countless other family members, friends and colleagues. Family will receive friends from 11am-1pm on Saturday, October 20, 2018 at St. Mark's Episcopal Church, 2151 Dorset Road, Upper Arlington, Ohio, where a Memorial Service will immediately follow at 1pm.

      "Rev. John J. King, OMI, 86, died on May 2, 2015, at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Residence, Tewksbury, Massachusetts, after a period of declining health. He was born on July 2, 1928, in Lowell, Massachusetts, a son of the late William J. and Mary Ellen (Delaney) King and one of seven children. In addition to his parents, he was predeceased by two brothers: William King and Stephen King, and four sisters: Anne Heenen, Frances McNamara, Kathleen Moynahan, and Mary Steele.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fr. King was educated in Lowell through high school. He attended college at Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, and Maryknoll Seminary in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania. He did his theology studies at the Oblate College in Washington, DC, and his doctoral studies in theology at the Catholic University of America, also in Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "He entered the Oblate Novitiate in Ipswich, Massachusetts, on September 7, 1950. He professed his first vows on September 8, 1951, and his perpetual vows on September 8, 1954. The late Bishop Arsene Turquetil, OMI, ordained him to the priesthood in Washington, DC, on December 18, 1954. He celebrated 60 years of priesthood this past December.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fr. King began his ministry in 1955 as a professor of theology at the Oblate College (Scholasticate) in Washington, DC. His skill as a teacher is attested to by the fact that he could make the study of Hebrew interesting! He became the \"theological secretary\" to the apostolic delegate to the United States, Archbishop (later Cardinal) Egidio Vagnozzi. During the Second Vatican Council in Rome, Archbishop Vagnozzi appointed Fr. King his peritus (an expert in theology who was present to give advice to individual bishops). He later served as a member of the U.S. Bishops' Press Panel, who met with the media after each session of the Council. In 1963 he was assigned to be the Superior of the Studium Generale in Rome. In 1966 he returned to the Scholasticate in Washington, DC, but in 1968 he returned to Rome as a General Councilor for the United States region, serving at the Oblate General House.\n",

      "In 1975, Fr. King went with the first group of Oblates to Puerto Rico where he served as Pastor, first at San Antonio de Padua Parish in Ceiba, and then at Our Lady of Fatima in DaGuao. In 1981, he returned to Lowell as the Director of the Hispanic Ministry Center. After a sabbatical year, he was in residence at St. John the Evangelist in Mullens, West Virginia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, Fr. King felt increasingly called to silence and solitude. In 1985, he became a hermit, first at the Oblates' Lebh Shomea House of Prayer in Sarita, Texas, and then in Godfrey, Illinois, at the Oblate National Novitiate. In June of 1989, Fr. King became the hermit chaplain at the Monastic Family of Bethlehem, of the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno in Livingston Manor, New York. Due to health issues, he moved to the Immaculate Heart of Mary Residence in 2013 where he remained until his death.\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2013, Wei expanded the scope of his business to Los Angeles where he joined forces with an experienced team of bankers and real estate partners to form Sun Capital. As Chairman, Wei and his team were responsible for four significant development projects in L.A.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wei gave much of his time and resources to organizations throughout Memphis, a community that he loved dearly. He sat on the Greater Memphis Chamber Board, University of Memphis Alumni Association National Alumni Executive Board, University of Memphis Fogelman College Dean's Advisory Board and the University of Memphis Management Department Advisory Board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wei was an active member of the Young Presidents Organization (YPO) - a global network of chief executives in more than 130 countries. Wei was a leader among leaders, serving in many leadership positions coaching and helping CEOs around the world. He was most passionate about serving as the chairman of the Doing Business with China Network for YPO International. This international network won the best of the best award globally in YPO under Wei's leadership. Wei's passion was to build a bridge between YPO and China - bringing together members of YPO from the US and China and encouraging them to partner together. Scott Mordell, CEO of YPO recalls, \"Wei was an inspiration for leaders across the world of YPO due to his can-do spirit and optimism.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wei loved giving back in a meaningful way, which is why he and Isabel established the Sunshine Scholars scholarship fund for the University of Memphis International MBA program. The fund provides top students with financial support during the 18-month program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wei was past board chair of the Memphis in May International Festival. During his time with Memphis in May, he contributed to the concepting of 901Fest - a celebration of the deep creative talent that Memphis has to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wei was actively involved in the Memphis Chinese community and was co-founder of the Greater Memphis United Chinese Association. Jiada Mo, former mechanical engineering professor at the University of Memphis and Wei's co-founder of the Greater Memphis United Chinese Association, said, \"Wei was a dear friend and pillar of support for our causes and initiatives. His work ethic, intelligence and compassion for those around him made him a great role model for the Memphis Chinese community.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wei was known for having boundless energy and courage. Just four years after earning his pilot's license in 2007, Wei became the first Chinese citizen to fly a single-engine airplane around the world. This brave flight raised awareness and funds for\n",
      ", a cause close to Wei's heart. This historic flight also marked the first single-engine airplane landing at Beijing Capital International Airport and the first fly-around-the-world trip across China restricted airspace, which remarkably introduced private aviation to China. The experience led Wei to write \"Around the World in 69 Days\" as well as the Chinese version of the same book titled \"80,000 Miles Above the Clouds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wei was a founding partner of Sky Aviation, a Los Angeles based private jet aviation company. He was a consummate aviator, having piloted aircraft in 49 of the 50 United States, as well as all seven continents. As an ATP-rated pilot with well over 2,000 flight hours, Wei pursued additional ratings and certificates few outside the military had attained.\n",
      "\n",
      "True to his loving, courageous spirit, an eyewitness who saw Wei's troubled flight in Atlanta on December 20 recounted that Wei visibly did everything he could to avoid hitting the many homes in the area where the plane's descent was taking place. Wei landed the plane in the only clearing available, successfully preventing further injury and damage in the heavily residential area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wei will perhaps be best remembered for his zeal and fervor - in business and in life. Many family members, friends and colleagues have heard him ask: \"What would you attempt to do if you knew you couldn't fail?\" This simple question, introduced to Wei by motivational speaker Dr. Robert Schuller, will remain symbolic of Wei's passion for life's experiences. Wei was also fond of sharing another favorite quote, by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first elected female head of state in Africa: \"If your dreams don't scare you, they aren't big enough.\"\n",

He was born on July 6, 1946, to Paul and Mary Miller in Canton, Ohio, where he was raised. David graduated summa cum laude with a degree in Biology from Bowling Green State University in 1968. He then attended the\n",
      "School of Medicine and graduated cum laude with a degree in Medicine in 1972. Dr. Miller was board certified in Internal and Pulmonary Medicine and a Fellow in the American College of Chest Physicians. Dr. Miller moved his family to Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1977 where he established a successful medical practice, specializing in pulmonary medicine. He will always be remembered for the love, care and empathy he had for his patients. In the early 1980's, Dr. Miller was one of the first doctors in South Texas to actively care for AIDS patients. His first AIDS patient referral came from Dr. Hector P. Garcia Jr. He taught HIV/AIDS care and prevention in the Coastal Bend community and was asked to present at countless national and international medical conferences, including the International AIDS Conference. Dr. Miller was both a physician and educator. In 1989 he began teaching as an adjunct professor at\n",
      "Corpus Christi in the College of Nursing and Health Sciences. He continued to teach after retiring from his medical practice. In 2010 he joined the faculty full time, as Associate Professor in the Family Nurse Practitioner Program. During his tenure at the university, he was a published author and contributor of many professional articles and books. Dr. Miller was the recipient of numerous honors and awards during his lifetime. In 1993, he received the Corpus Christi Diocesan Medal of Honor award, presented to him by Bishop Rene Gracida for pro bono health services he provided to the community. Recognized by his peers in 2005, the Dr. David A. Miller Scholarship was established in his honor by the Sigma Theta Tau International Nursing Honor Society. This scholarship provides educational funding to students in the nursing program. Most recently, in April of this year, he was presented the Excellence in Teaching Award by Texas A&M University Corpus Christi, Center for Faculty Excellence. Dr. Miller was a man of deep faith and devotion. His faith in God carried him through the last 12 years of his life, after his first cancer diagnosis in 2003. He believed it was the power of prayer that granted him that time and afforded him the opportunity to create more precious memories with family and friends. Dr. Miller will be remembered for many things, in particular his love of music, Christmas, and his quick sense of humor. A long time member of the Corpus Christi Cathedral and Hand bell Choirs, Dr. Miller, was also a master of the piano and organ. He enjoyed entertaining his family and friends, spontaneously composing impromptu recitals on the piano. Christmas was without doubt his favorite holiday. The house required several trees to display his continuously growing collection of ornaments that were admired by all and cherished by him. Dr. Miller understood that laughter was the most important gift in life. He skillfully used humor for healing and comfort for all those around him, including himself. Those in his presence, both in carefree times and when hope seemed out of reach, would invariably share a dose of laughter that could only be prescribed by him. He shared his humor with family and friends, up until his final hours. But most important of all, David Miller was a loving husband, father, grandfather and friend.Dr. Miller was preceded in death by his parents, Paul and Mary Miller. He is survived by his wife, of 39 years, Mary Ellen Miller; Daughter Sara (Jason) Ryan; Sons, John (Maria) Bianco, David Bianco and Joe (Kimberly) Bianco; grandchildren, Katherine Bianco, Felecia Bianco, Hannah Ryan, Olivia Bianco, Delaney Bianco, Nicholas Ryan and longtime, dear family friend and 'sister', Annette Palomo.Visitation will be held from 3:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on Friday, May 29, 2015, with a Rosary to be recited at 7:00 p.m. at Seaside Funeral Home Chapel. A Funeral Mass will be celebrated at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, May 30, 2015, at the Corpus Christi Cathedral.In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to the following:The Cathedral Concert Series, 620 Lipan Street Corpus Christi, Texas 78401The Dr. David A.
